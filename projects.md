## Credit Scoring Analytics
Develop a machine learning-based system to predict the credit risk of a customer. Experiment with different machine learning approaches or algorithms and compare them to find the best performing model and develop a simple prototype of the system.

## Churn Prediction System (MLOps)
Developed a full ML pipeline to predict customer churn using Random Forest classifiers. Implemented MLOps workflow using MLflow for experiment tracking and model registry. Deployed the trained model via REST API using Flask and served it with Docker containers. Built monitoring dashboard with Prometheus and Grafana to track prediction latency, request count, and model performance.
